# GarbageSegregatio Application

## Description

The app, titled "GarbageSegregatio Application", aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage waste disposal and promote environmental sustainability.

Key features of the app include:

- Image recognition for waste identification
- Step-by-step instructions for proper waste disposal
- User profiles to track disposal history and environmental impact
- Gamification elements to incentivize eco-friendly behaviour, such as earning points or badges for proper waste disposal
